# How Are Journalists Covering Stories in Gaza?
 
Since October 7, the conflicts in the Gaza Strip have consistently made headlines. Journalists have employed various methods to report on the conflict, including on-the-ground coverage, exploration of related themes, and utilization of open-source intelligence techniques.

In this project, I used CSS and HTML to create a scrollytelling interactive story. I interviewed three journalists, Haley Willis, a reporter for The New York Times, and Adam Rayes and Briana Rice, journalists for Michigan Public Radio, about their techniques covering the conflict, without being on the ground.
