  <div class="content">
    <p >Since October 7, the conflicts in the Gaza Strip have consistently made headlines. Journalists have employed various methods to report on the conflict, including on-the-ground coverage, exploration of related themes, and utilization of open-source intelligence techniques.</p>
    <h2>Open-Source Intelligence Techniques</h2>
    <p> Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) has emerged as a primary method of reporting on the conflict in Gaza, due to blockades preventing journalists from accessing the area and the hazardous conditions on the ground. Consequently, many journalists have turned to satellite imagery, ship and flight tracking data, as well as photos and videos shared on social media, to gain insights into the situation in Gaza. </p>
    <p>OSINT plays a crucial role in geolocation, allowing journalists to pinpoint the precise location where a particular video or picture shared on social media was captured. Journalists can accurately identify the locations depicted in the media by analyzing various elements within the visual content, such as landmarks, geographical features, or street signs. Navigating this issue can be challenging, due to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1212889717/satellite-images-us-israel-gaza&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1713570513682602&usg=AOvVaw1uPUQytCHXataAGnSImhNd">laws that impose restrictions on the quality of commercial satellite imagery that U.S. companies are permitted to sell </a> if the images portray Israel and Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, such as Gaza. 
    </p>
      
    <p>However, the use of these techniques necessitates rigorous verification, fact-checking, and ethical coverage of the visual content employed. this is essential to ensure the accuracy of information and to mitigate the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and misinformation, in the case of many videos and pictures that became viral on social media platforms, including  X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok.</p>
    <p>One example is this New York Times video, which focused on an Israeli military video of the chaotic scene that resulted in mass casualties when people gathered around food aid trucks in northern Gaza, on February 29, 2024.</p>

    <p>Haley Willis, a reporter for the New York Times working on the visual investigations team, specializes in analyzing visual evidence sourced from various platforms, including social media, security camera footage, and satellite imagery.</p>

    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step" id="step-first">
        <p>The main focus of the investigation conducted by the NYT team revolved around a video released by the Israeli military, which I accessed via<a href="https://videoidf.azureedge.net/1d710ee2-8ddd-4146-9e07-6dd6d5960c27"> videoidf.azureedge.net. </a> In this footage, a large group of people is seen surrounding trucks before dispersing. The New York Times investigations team analyzed and described the events depicted in the video, which initially appeared unclear or difficult to interpret.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-second">
        <p>““There are a lot of local journalists who are doing amazing work and posting a lot of stuff online,” Willis said. “And that gives us a view into what's happening. There's a very robust local journalism environment in Gaza, and some really incredible journalists doing that work. Also just a lot of people in Gaza who are sharing a lot of content.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-third">
        <p>“I do think the amount of stuff on social media that's been coming out of Gaza has been quite unique in the way that it has kind of captured people online. I mean, there are other barriers, of course, like total blocking of access, which happens in other places as well. But, you know, in previous conflicts in Gaza, journalists have been able to go and that has been a very different case here.”</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-fourth">
        <p> “Anything that comes out online, whether it be from a Palestinian living in Gaza or from the IDF or UN, or like an official Hamas channel, we go through the process of verifying that, which is a few different steps, like so that it can be, first of all, established where and when it was filmed.” </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-fifth">
        <p>“So what is it showing? Like what part of Gaza is this in, when did this happen? Like was it yesterday or was it two weeks ago or sometimes, you know, things get shared from older conflicts unintentionally. Confirming those kinds of basic details. Then on top of that, obviously doing additional, more intensive analysis and cross-referencing the visuals we're seeing with other types of reporting,” Willis explained.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-sixth">
        <p>“We'll often look for videos of different angles of an incident, and compare them to each other, like five different videos. How do they match up? What do they all show? Obviously we'll try to interview people that were there, or interview people that were impacted to see where there might be discrepancies in what matches up and what doesn't,” Willis said.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step-seventh">
        <p> “We do have to move quickly sometimes,” Willis said. “We just try to be really transparent about what we know and what we don't know. The ideal scenario is you have six months to investigate everything and know every single detail, but that's not realistic. And obviously, there's kind of an urgency to what's happening right now in Gaza and the pace and scale of the conflict. And so we do want to move quickly and get this information out there. What we tend to do is just be very transparent about what we've confirmed and what we haven't confirmed. I do think when it comes to moving quickly, it's just important to make very clear to your readers what you don't know yet.”

    <p>In an example of how Willis has verified information, she mentions that IDF released a video depicting a strike they conducted, labeling an individual as carrying an RPG, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. However, upon closer examination, it appeared that the person was actually pushing a bicycle, not holding a weapon. 
    </p>
      <p>"We analyzed the video and realized that it looked like the person was actually pushing a bicycle, not holding a weapon," Willis said. "We were in touch with an NGO who had actually spoken to witnesses of the attack and confirmed the same thing."
      </p>
        <p>By combining visual analysis with witness testimony, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/12/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news/the-israeli-military-acknowledges-mistaking-a-bike-for-a-weapon-in-a-strike-but-stands-by-the-attack?smid=url-share"> team felt confident in their assessment. </a>This is just one more example of the use of OSINT in reporting.
        </p>
          <p>"Combining the visual analysis with what we had heard from witnesses, we were able to feel pretty confident about that and reach out to the Israeli military," Willis explained.

    <h2> Interconnected Narratives of Palestinian Identity, Antisemitism, and Protests Amidst the Gaza Conflict</h2>
  </div>

  <div class = "content">
    <p>Journalists worldwide have been innovative in covering topics related to the Gaza conflict from their homes, showcasing the interconnectedness of global events. Coverage extends from exploring Palestinian identity and addressing antisemitism to reporting on protests, demonstrating the breadth of issues surrounding the conflict.
    </p>

    <p>Adam Rayes and Briana Rice, journalists for Michigan Public Radio, wrote a piece that discussed <a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/community/2024-03-07/no-easy-trip-home-how-palestinian-americans-are-making-sense-of-their-identity-right-now"> Palestinian identity in Michigan. </a> In their piece, they cover Palestinian-Americans, their connections to the conflict, and their struggles with identity, heritage, and the pain of intergenerational trauma. Rice says that they wanted to do a story about census data in the area. They wanted to know how many Palestinians there were. They interviewed people in Dearborn and Detroit, cities with a large Arab population, but they also wanted to capture the people who were not counted on the census data.
    </p>

    <p>“What does it mean to be Palestinian right now?” she said. “That's kind of how we approached it. We wanted to know from different generations. And I think older generations were a little more hesitant to talk about this, and rightfully so. It's been a lot more dangerous for them.”
    </p>

    <p>Covering issues related to Gaza and Palestinian identity has been a hard task. Rice reflects: "I think they're like really hard conversations, honestly. I think to talk about identity and give space to talk about Gaza and politics, but try to make sure that we're keeping it about identity and home and like what it means to be Palestinian."
    </p>
     <p> Rayes shares a similar sentiment, drawing parallels to his own experiences as a Syrian-American.  "I am Syrian,” he said, “and with the civil war there and sort of being born here and having never been able to visit and just sort of like watching all that unfold." rayes emphasizes the shared trauma and survivor’s guilt he feels with Palestinians, despite the differences in their experiences. their journalistic journey involves not only uncovering stories but also navigating personal trauma. 
    </p>

<p>"I was constantly afraid that I was going to be falling short of just making sure that these people felt well represented,” he said, “because I know what it feels like to be sort of portrayed in this way, that it's just you only exist in the context of violence, right?  And you only get to talk about it in that context."
</p>

<p> "It is just how rare this sort of space is for Palestinians right now,” Rayes said. “ We kept on walking away from every interview, and every person would thank us and say, ‘There's just like no space for me to have this sort of conversation right now.’ "
</p>

<p> Despite the challenges, Rice found hope in the human connection forged through their reporting. "I will remember [this experience] forever. I was surprised constantly by the people."

While praised by some, critics argue it could impede free speech and unfairly equate criticism of Israeli policies with antisemitism. Colleges have 90 days to revise policies, amid nationwide tensions following the Gaza conflict. Federal efforts to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia are also noted, including discussions and resources provided by the Department of Education.

        <p>One of the primary methods for journalists to understand public sentiment regarding the war in Gaza is by covering manifestations, such as protests, both in the United States and globally. BY conducting interviews with participants, journalists gain insights into the motivations driving individuals to protest and their personal connections to the conflict. This approach provides a deeper understanding of public perceptions and sentiments surrounding the ongoing events in Gaza.

  <h2>On The Ground Reporting</h2>
 <p>One significant avenue through which people obtain news from Gaza is via Gazan journalists, who have amassed millions of followers on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. This form of first-person journalism, primarily followed by a younger audience, has surged in popularity. It serves as an alternative for a population with high levels of distrust toward more traditional news media entities, offering viewers a more intimate narrative directly from sources they can better identify with.

  On-the-ground reporting in Gaza has also exacted a significant toll on those in the area. According to the <a href= "https://cpj.org/2024/03/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2028%2C%202024,and%201%2C200%20deaths%20in%20Israel"> Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) </a>, as of March 30, 2024, CPJ's preliminary investigations revealed that at least 95 journalists and media workers are among the more than 33,000 individuals killed in Gaza since the war began on October 7. Of the 95 journalists confirmed dead, 90 were Palestinian, 2 were Israeli, and 3 were Lebanese. Additionally, other journalists have been reported missing, injured, arrested, or subjected to multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and even experienced the killings of family members in Gaza.
