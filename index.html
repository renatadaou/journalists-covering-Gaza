      <h1>How Are Journalists Covering Stories in Gaza?</h1>
      <p class="subhead">Since October 7, the conflicts in the Gaza Strip have consistently made headlines. Journalists have employed various methods to report on the conflict, including on-the-ground coverage, exploration of related themes, and utilization of open-source intelligence techniques.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Open-Source Intelligence Techniques</h2>
    <p>Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) have emerged as a primary method of reporting on the conflict in Gaza due to blockades preventing journalists from accessing the area and the hazardous conditions on the ground. Consequently, many journalists have turned to satellite imagery, as well as photos and videos shared on social media, to gain insights into the situation in Gaza.</p>
    <p>OSINT plays a crucial role in geolocation, allowing journalists to pinpoint the precise locations where a particular video or picture shared on social media was captured. By analyzing various elements within the visual content, such as landmarks, geographical features, or street signs, journalists can accurately identify the locations depicted in the media. Navigating this issue can be challenging due to <a href= "https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1212889717/satellite-images-us-israel-gaza" >federal laws that impose restrictions on the quality of commercial satellite imagery that U.S. companies are permitted to sell </a>, particularly if the images portray Israel and Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories like Gaza.
    </p>

    <p>However, the use of these techniques necessitates rigorous verification, fact-checking, and ethical coverage of the visual content employed. This is essential to ensure the accuracy of information and to mitigate the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and misinformation, which has been common with many videos and pictures that became viral on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok.</p>
    <p>An example would be this New York Times video, which focused on an Israeli military video revealing the chaotic scene that resulted in mass casualties as people gathered around food aid trucks in northern Gaza.</p>

        <p>The main focus of the investigation conducted by the NYT team revolved around a video released by the Israeli military, which I accessed via <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://videoidf.azureedge.net/1d710ee2-8ddd-4146-9e07-6dd6d5960c27%26sa%3DD%26source%3Ddocs%26ust%3D1711811904525253%26usg%3DAOvVaw3ad1nEYSUNQ4RZZp0HUvva&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711812140777567&usg=AOvVaw3iryLZL8qGYOuaevxVneUy"> videoidf.azureedge.net. </a> In this footage, a large group of people is seen surrounding trucks before dispersing.

    <p>Journalists worldwide have innovatively covered topics related to the Gaza conflict from their homes, showcasing the interconnectedness of global events. Coverage extends from exploring Palestinian identity and addressing antisemitism to reporting on protests, demonstrating the breadth of issues surrounding the conflict.
    </p>

    <p>Adam Rayes and Briana Rice, journalists for Michigan Public Radio, wrote a piece that reflected <a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/community/2024-03-07/no-easy-trip-home-how-palestinian-americans-are-making-sense-of-their-identity-right-now">identity in Michigan. </a> In their piece, they cover Palestinian-Americans, their connections to the conflict, and their struggles with identity, heritage, and the pain of intergenerational trauma. Rice says that they wanted to do a story about census data in the area. They wanted to know how many Palestinians there were. They interviewed people from Dearborn, Detroit, an area known for having a large Arab population, but they also wanted to capture the people who were not counted on the census data.
    </p>

    <p>“What does it mean to be Palestinian right now?” she said. “That's kind of how we approached it. We wanted to know from different generations. And I think older generations were a little more hesitant to talk about this, and rightfully so. It's been a lot more dangerous for them.”
</p>

    <p>Covering issues related to Gaza and Palestinian identity has been a hard task. She reflects, "I think they're like really hard conversations, honestly. I think to talk about identity and give space to talk about Gaza and politics but try to make sure that we're keeping it about identity and home and like what it means to be Palestinian."
</p>
<P>Rayes shares a similar sentiment, drawing parallels to his own experiences as a Syrian-American. He remarks, "I am Syrian and with the civil war there and sort of being born here and having never been able to visit and just sort of like watching all that unfold." Rayes emphasizes the shared trauma and survivor’s guilt he feels with Palestinians, despite the differences in their experiences. Their journalistic journey involves not only uncovering stories but also navigating personal trauma. 
</P>
<p>"I was constantly afraid that I was going to be falling short of just making sure that these people felt well represented because I know what it feels like, to be sort of portrayed in this way, that it's just you only exist in the context of violence, right?” He said. “And you only get to talk about it in that context."</p>

<p> "It is just how rare this sort of space is for Palestinians right now,” Rayes said. “ We kept on walking away from every interview and every person would thank us and say ‘there's just like no space for me to have this sort of conversation right now.’"
</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, Rice found hope in the human connection forged through their reporting. "I will remember [this experience] forever. I was surprised constantly by the people."

While praised by some, critics argue it could impede free speech and unfairly equate criticism of Israeli policies with antisemitism. Colleges have 90 days to revise policies, amidst nationwide tensions following the Gaza conflict. Federal efforts to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia are also noted, including discussions and resources provided by the Department of Education.

        <p>Protesters in favor of Israel at Times Square, in New York City, on October 8, 2023. The protest was organized by the Jews of New York in response to the protest in favor of Palestine. Many protestors chanted against the attacks and kidnappings that happened in Israel. New York City has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. </p>

        <p>Protesters in favor of Palestine at Times Square, in New York City, on October 13, 2023. The protest was organized by the Palestinian Youth Movement of New York City. They protested against the blockade of Gaza and the Israeli treatment of Palestinians, as well as the creation of a Palestinian State.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step5">
        <p>One of the primary methods for journalists to understand public sentiment regarding the war in Gaza is by covering manifestations, such as protests, both in the United States and globally. Through conducting interviews with participants, journalists gain insights into the motivations driving individuals to protest and their personal connections to the conflict. This approach provides a deeper understanding of public perceptions and sentiments surrounding the ongoing events in Gaza.

  <h2>On The Ground Reporting</h2>
 <p>One significant avenue through which people obtain news from Gaza is via Gazan journalists who have amassed millions of followers on social media platforms like Instagram and Tik Tok. This form of first-person journalism, primarily consumed by the younger generation, has surged in popularity. It serves as an alternative for a population with high levels of distrust towards more traditional news media companies, offering viewers a more intimate narrative directly from sources they can better identify with.</p>

 <p>Motaz Azaiza, a Palestinian photojournalist from Gaza, gained prominence for his coverage of the Israel–Hamas war, amassing a substantial following on social media, reaching 18.3M followers as of March, 2024. In 2023, he earned the title of <a href="https://www.gqmiddleeast.com/men-of-the-year/shop-gq-motaz-azaiza-man-of-the-year#:~:text=That%20is%20why%2C%20the%20team,ones%20that%20we%20don't">Man of the Year from GQ Middle East </a>, and one of his photographs of a girl stuck under her house rubble after it was bombed by Israeli airstrikes at the Al Nusairat refugee camp  was honored as one of <a href= "https://time.com/6337364/top-100-photos-2023/Time's">top 10 photos of 2023. </a> </p>

    On-the-ground reporting in Gaza has also exacted a significant toll on those in the area. According to the <a href= "https://cpj.org/2024/03/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2028%2C%202024,and%201%2C200%20deaths%20in%20Israel"> Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) </a>, as of March 30, 2024, CPJ's preliminary investigations revealed that at least 95 journalists and media workers were among the more than 33,000 individuals killed since the war began on October 7. Of the 95 journalists confirmed dead, 90 were Palestinian, 2 were Israeli, and 3 were Lebanese. Additionally, other journalists have been reported missing, injured, arrested, or subjected to multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and even experienced the killings of family members.
